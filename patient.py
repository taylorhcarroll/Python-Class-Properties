# Create a class to represent a patient of a doctor's office. The Patient class will accept the following
# information during initialization

# Social security number
# Date of birth
# Health insurance account number
# First name
# Last name
# Address
# The first three properties should be read-only. First name and last name should not be exposed as properties
# at all, but instead expose a calculated property of full_name. Address should have a getter and setter.
